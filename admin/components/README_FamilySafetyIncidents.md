### Integration
The component is integrated into the main Safety module with a tab-based interface:

import { FamilySafetyIncidents } from './FamilySafetyIncidents'

// In the Safety component
{activeTab === 'incidents' ? (
  <FamilySafetyIncidents />
) : (
  // Other safety management content
)}
```
